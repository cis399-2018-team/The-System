We shut down the apache server on system2, and reloaded the webpage through TheSystemBalancer address.
The page loaded up without an issue.
We saw that the balancer 'status' switched to showing '1 of 2 instances in service'.
Then, we shut down the apache server on system1, and refreshed the webpage on TheSystemBalancer,
we received a blank page, and the balancer status showed '0 of 2 instances in service'
When we started the apache server on either system, and the page showed up on TheSystemBalancer.
The balancer status showed that the instance was back in service.

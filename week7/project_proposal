Our aim is to create a website that classifies input images using a prebuilt machine learning model in the browser.
	- Our site will be deployed on our Apache server, using Flask as the web framework and MongoDB as our database.
		- Will add some security modules for Apache to harden our server.
		- Also disable directory listing, restrict access to directories, and hide server version and OS from error pages
	- We will create various puppet files to configure and manage our server.
		- A puppet module will be created for each essential piece of our stack.
	- We want this website to be used as an easy to use example of what machine learning can do.
		- This can be helpful to help anyone, of any age, to understand what current machine learning algorithms are capable of.
	- The user will drag images onto a webpage and the image will be classified.
		- The page will output text stating what it thinks it is and how sure it is about it.
		- The user will then click a button saying that if is correct or not.
		- We plan to use our database to store data about any image that was succesfully classfied with an accuracy of 75% or higher and labled as correct by the user. 
	- Testing of our backend will be implented using python nosetests
		- This will help ensure we are saving clean data to our database.
	- Testing of our site in production will be done using puppet
		- We will randomly delete and move file and log whether puppet fixes the configuration or not.
	- Documentation
		- Technical documentation will be on our The-System-puppet repo
		- Usage instructions for user will be on the site itself
